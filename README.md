# CNN_from_scratch

The goal of this repo is to create detailed teaching material for people who really want to understand how CNNs work "under the hood" to see how they work. It is a work in progress.

To that end, the [`CNN_explanation`](CNN_explanation.ipynb) notebook contains the beginnings of an explanation of how backpropogation through the convolutional and pooling layers of a CNN work.

The [`CNN_From_Scratch`](CNN_From_Scratch.ipynb) notebook contains just the Python code you'll need to implement a CNN from scratch.

[This repo](https://github.com/andersbll/nnet), which implements CNNs in Cython, was used as a starting point.
